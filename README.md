# Obl.ong Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all who participate in our
project (either through registering on our website/obtaining a subdomain or by
making code contributions). It also includes our **Acceptable Use Policy** for
our domain services. Please read it carefully.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Acceptable Use Policy

The Obl.ong domain service is provided for the purpose of providing free subdomains
to all who wish to use them. However, this does not mean they may be used for __any__
purpose. We prohibit use of our subdomains for any of the behaviors listed above as
unacceptable, and for any of the following:

- any form of malware (which includes, without limitation, malicious code or software
  that may affect the operation of the Internet);
- any form of botnets, spam, or phishing;
- interfering with or disrupting servers or networks, or disobeying any requirements,
  procedures, policies, or regulation of networks;
- harming minors in any way, including the distribution of child pornographic images;
- impersonating any person or entity, including, but not limited to, an official, forum
  leader, guide or host, or falsely stating or otherwise misrepresenting its affiliation
  with a person or entity;
- using a domain name for activity comprising or contributing to piracy, trademark or
  copyright infringement, fraudulent or deceptive practices, counterfeiting, or other
  illegal activity;
- insighting or promoting violence against any person or groups of persons, which shall include but is not limited to LGBTQ persons;
- bullying, engaging in cyper bullying, or inciting others to bully;
- harassing, or encouraging others to harass or harm others;
- stalking;
- abusive intent to cause fear or threaten violence;
- hate speech (including homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism, sexism, ableism,
  casteism, xenophobia, antisemitism, islamophobia, and other forms of bigotry);
- content which may be illegal under German or Scottish law;
- content containing Nazi symbolism, ideology, and the promotion thereof;
- content which claims to forbid/disavow abusive or hateful conduct, but which permits
  "respectful" "discussions" of "unpopular opinions"/"controversial views" (dessert pizza
  is an unpopular opinion, trans folks' right to live a happy life is not, and hate is hate
  regardless of how dressed-up it is);
- any other activity intended to organize, coordinate, or otherwise enable any of the above.

Registrations are prohibited to parties that are, or associated with, recognized
hate groups, or are otherwise engaged in hate speech.

This list is not comprehensive, and we reserve the right to revoke any subdomain at
any time. Obl.ong is not responsible for and does not actively monitor registrant's
content, and therefore, cannot guarantee that content hosted on our subdomains does
not violate this policy. Failure to enforce this policy or respond to a complaint
does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it; nor does this policy create
any obligations to users or any third-party beneficiary rights or private rights of
action.

To report content which you believe to be a violation of the above policy, please email [team@obl.ong](mailto:team@obl.ong).

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[team@obl.ong](mailto:team@obl.ong).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
